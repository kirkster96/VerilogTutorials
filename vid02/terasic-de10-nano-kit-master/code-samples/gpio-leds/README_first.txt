This directory contains three different example directories that contain
documentation and examples for interacting with the GPIO resources on the Altas
board.

raw-gpio - contains a README file that describes how to discover and interact
           with the gpio framework provided by the linux environment on the
           DE10-Nano target.  There is a script and two C programs that
           demonstrate how to programmatically detect the state of the KEY0 push
           button on the DE10-Nano board.  The script and one C program simply
           read the state, output it and exit, the second C program enables the
           interrupt functionality for the GPIO and waits for the push button
           press to generate the interrupt that it waits for.

gpio-keys - contains a README file that describes how to discover and interact
            with the gpio-keys framework provided by the linux environment on
            the DE10-Nano target.  There is a script and two C programs that
            demonstrate how to programmatically detect the input events
            generated by the SW0, SW1, SW2 and SW3 switches on the DE10-Nano
            board.  The script and one C program simply report the input events
            as they are detected, the second C program adds a call to the
            ioctl() function to read the current state of all four switches as
            each input event is processed.

gpio-leds - contains a README file that describes how to discover and interact
            with the gpio-leds framework provided by the linux environment on
            the DE10-Nano target.  There is a script and a C program that
            demonstrate how to programmatically control the LEDS on the
            DE10-Nano board.

Please see the README files in each sub directory for more information.
